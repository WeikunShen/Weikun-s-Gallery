      <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>Born in Shenyang, China. When you try to define art and find a standard to evaluate art, you will find that art is often broad and abstract. But maybe you can try to define an artist. Idealism focuses on facts, pessimism wants to be optimistic, a divisive mind. This is my assessment of myself. I enjoy exploring the depths of people's personalities and am good at looking into my own soul. But at the same time, I also appreciate the simplest, superficial art. Because of this, my work is also divided and pluralistic.

        I'm trying to take the art of making seriously, but it just doesn't seem to fit me. I prefer making art as a way to entertain myself. I'm trying not to let myself care about the opinions expressed and the audience's feelings, because I think it's a limitation. Maybe taking artistic creation seriously, I mean constantly thinking about the way of expression and expressing ideas will definitely bring the artwork to a higher level, but it will make my artwork feel less "me". I think the medium used by art is free. Although my major is digital media art, I still prefer more "traditional" art forms.Or a combination of the two, I'm not limited to a single medium.
