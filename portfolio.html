        <h3>Peace and Fret</h3>
        <p>Peace and Fret. Both of them lived inside me. Yet, which one is the real one and which will define me? I chose to review both of them on the screen at the same time</p>

      <h3>Composite Art - ZEN</h3>
      <p>An art work created by photoshop</p>
      <p>It is a place hidden in my mind; a place to find my peace in. A lake flat like a mirror. </p>  
      <p>The only thing I used is a wrinkled paper.
         By chaging the lightness of the image, I easily create different layers for the scene.</p>

      <h3>Crazy Error</h3>
      <p>My first experience of internet: poor internet. Everytime I met an error, I had no idea how to slove it but to follow the instructions.</p>

      <p>Fly in to the sky! Me and my partner Angel Flores created this little simple game together as an experiment. I am the main artist and producer. Simplest Game, simplest Joy!</p>

     <h3> HOME/INNERPEACE</h3>
<p>

This piece was created during the Covid, when everything was shut down and the flights were cancled. I am really homesick since I haven't been home and seen my family since last year summer, and now I realize how important they are to me. I can never feel the peaceful way they offer me from anywhere else. To everyone who loves their family.

      <h3>Photography -- Autumn</h3>
     
      <p>Everyday I passed by, everyday I missed it. The people, the things around you, come and gone. It is a season for life ending, but also a season for reborn. I want to take a closer look, to oberve, to record. </p>
