        <h3>Peace and Fret</h3>
        <p>Peace and Fret. Both of them lived inside me. Yet, which one is the real one and which will define me? I chose to review both of them on the screen at the same time</p>

      <h3>Composite Art - ZEN</h3>
      <p>An art work created by photoshop</p>
      <p>It is a place hidden in my mind; a place to find my peace in. A lake flat like a mirror. </p>  
      <p>The only thing I used is a wrinkled paper.
         By chaging the lightness of the image, I easily create different layers for the scene.</p>

        <h3>3D Modle - ZEN</h3>
         <p>An art work created by Blender & PolyCam</p>
        <p>Just like the Composit Art piece with the same name, this is also a work piece that I created for myself. Building a place where I can feel peace. </p>  
        <p>I scaned all elements that I felt peaceful while I am using in my home and fuse them together in blender to create a Zen garden.</p>

              <h3> Raining World</h3>
         <p>Looking out of the window and it's raining. It's like the whole world is blurred, just like my mood, messy. Raindrops hit the window, gradually wash the sight, but also wipe away the dust in my heart.</p>

     <h3> HOME/INNERPEACE</h3>
<p>

This piece was created during the Covid, when everything was shut down and the flights were cancled. I am really homesick since I haven't been home and seen my family since last year summer, and now I realize how important they are to me. I can never feel the peaceful way they offer me from anywhere else. To everyone who loves their family.

      <h3>Photography -- Autumn</h3>
     
      <p>Everyday I passed by, everyday I missed it. The people, the things around you, come and gone. It is a season for life ending, but also a season for reborn. I want to take a closer look, to oberve, to record. </p>
